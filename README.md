We have two sections:

1) traditional biomarker detection (t.test between cases and controls). 

1a) On the annotated metabolties (that is, the metabolites we could identify with online databases)

2) Datamining on the whole Guthrie card - imagine we are willing to mass-spec every newborn's blood drop. How well can we detect JMML?
